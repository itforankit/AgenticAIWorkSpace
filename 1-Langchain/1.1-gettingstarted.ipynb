      "content='Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems designed to operate with a degree of autonomy, making decisions and taking actions to achieve specific goals with minimal human intervention. The term \"agentic\" stems from the concept of an \"agent\" in computer science and philosophy, which is an entity capable of perceiving its environment and acting upon it to effect change.\\n\\n### Key Characteristics of Agentic AI:\\n\\n1. **Autonomy:** Agentic AI systems can perform tasks and make decisions without constant human oversight. They possess the ability to set goals, plan actions, and execute them independently.\\n\\n2. **Perception:** These AI agents can sense and interpret data from their environment through various sensors or data inputs, enabling them to understand and react to changes.\\n\\n3. **Goal-Oriented Behavior:** Agentic AI is typically designed with specific objectives. They can prioritize tasks, adapt to new information, and adjust their strategies to achieve their goals effectively.\\n\\n4. **Learning and Adaptation:** Many agentic AI systems incorporate machine learning techniques, allowing them to improve their performance over time based on experience and feedback.\\n\\n5. **Interaction:** They can interact with other systems, users, or agents, facilitating complex operations that may require coordination and communication.\\n\\n### Examples of Agentic AI:\\n\\n- **Autonomous Vehicles:** Self-driving cars navigate roads, make real-time decisions, and respond to dynamic traffic conditions without human control.\\n  \\n- **Robotic Process Automation (RPA):** Robots in manufacturing settings autonomously handle tasks such as assembly, quality control, and packaging.\\n  \\n- **Personal Assistants:** Advanced virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa can manage schedules, control smart home devices, and provide personalized recommendations autonomously.\\n\\n- **Intelligent Virtual Agents:** In customer service, these agents can handle inquiries, troubleshoot issues, and provide support without human intervention.\\n\\n### Applications of Agentic AI:\\n\\n- **Healthcare:** Autonomous diagnostic systems can analyze medical data, suggest treatments, and monitor patient health proactively.\\n\\n- **Finance:** AI agents can manage investment portfolios, detect fraudulent activities, and automate trading strategies.\\n\\n- **Logistics:** Autonomous drones and delivery robots optimize supply chains, manage inventory, and handle distribution tasks efficiently.\\n\\n- **Smart Infrastructure:** Intelligent systems manage energy distribution, traffic flow, and urban planning to enhance the functionality of cities.\\n\\n### Benefits:\\n\\n- **Efficiency:** Increased productivity through the automation of repetitive and time-consuming tasks.\\n  \\n- **Precision:** Enhanced accuracy in tasks such as data analysis, medical diagnostics, and manufacturing processes.\\n  \\n- **Scalability:** Ability to handle large-scale operations without a proportional increase in human resources.\\n\\n### Challenges and Considerations:\\n\\n- **Ethics and Accountability:** Determining responsibility when autonomous systems make decisions that have significant impacts.\\n  \\n- **Security:** Ensuring that agentic AI systems are protected against malicious attacks and unauthorized access.\\n  \\n- **Bias and Fairness:** Preventing the ingraining of biases in AI decision-making processes, especially in sensitive areas like hiring or law enforcement.\\n\\n- **Reliability:** Ensuring consistent and dependable performance in diverse and unpredictable environments.\\n\\n### Future Perspectives:\\n\\nAs technology advances, agentic AI is expected to become more sophisticated, integrating deeper learning capabilities, enhanced perception, and better decision-making processes. This evolution will likely lead to more widespread adoption across various industries, driving innovation while also necessitating robust frameworks to address ethical, legal, and societal implications.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn summary, agentic AI represents a significant stride towards more autonomous, intelligent systems capable of performing complex tasks with minimal human input. While offering numerous advantages in efficiency and capability, it also presents challenges that must be thoughtfully managed to ensure beneficial and responsible deployment.' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 936, 'prompt_tokens': 13, 'total_tokens': 949, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 192, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'o1-mini-2024-09-12', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_f56e40de61', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-1f371924-b46d-4413-8d0f-2d243416915b-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 13, 'output_tokens': 936, 'total_tokens': 949, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 192}}\n"

PolicyTutorialsBuild a simple LLM application with chat models and prompt templatesOn this pageBuild a simple LLM application with chat models and prompt templates\\nIn this quickstart we\\'ll show you how to build a simple LLM application with LangChain. This application will translate text from English into another language. This is a relatively simple LLM application - it\\'s just a single LLM call plus some prompting. Still, this is a great way to get started with LangChain - a lot of features can be built with just some prompting and an LLM call!\\nAfter reading this tutorial, you\\'ll have a high level overview of:\\n\\n\\nUsing language models\\n\\n\\nUsing prompt templates\\n\\n\\nDebugging and tracing your application using LangSmith\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s dive in!\\nSetup\\u200b\\nJupyter Notebook\\u200b\\nThis and other tutorials are perhaps most conveniently run in a Jupyter notebooks. Going through guides in an interactive environment is a great way to better understand them. See here for instructions on how to install.\\nInstallation\\u200b\\nTo install LangChain run:\\n\\nPipCondapip install langchainconda install langchain -c conda-forge\\nFor more details, see our Installation guide.\\nLangSmith\\u200b\\nMany of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.\\nAs these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.\\nThe best way to do this is with LangSmith.\\nAfter you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:\\nexport LANGSMITH_TRACING=\"true\"export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=\"...\"\\nOr, if in a notebook, you can set them with:\\nimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"LANGSMITH_TRACING\"] = \"true\"os.environ[\"LANGSMITH_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\\nUsing Language Models\\u200b\\nFirst up, let\\'s learn how to use a language model by itself. LangChain supports many different language models that you can use interchangeably. For details on getting started with a specific model, refer to supported integrations.\\n\\nSelect chat model:Groq▾GroqOpenAIAnthropicAzureGoogle VertexAWSCohereNVIDIAFireworks AIMistral AITogether AIDatabrickspip install -qU \"langchain[groq]\"import getpassimport osif not os.environ.get(\"GROQ_API_KEY\"):  os.environ[\"GROQ_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass(\"Enter API key for Groq: \")from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_modelmodel = init_chat_model(\"llama3-8b-8192\", model_provider=\"groq\")\\nLet\\'s first use the model directly. ChatModels are instances of LangChain Runnables, which means they expose a standard interface for interacting with them. To simply call the model, we can pass in a list of messages to the .invoke method.\\nfrom langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessagemessages = [    SystemMessage(\"Translate the following from English into Italian\"),    HumanMessage(\"hi!\"),]model.invoke(messages)API Reference:HumanMessage | SystemMessage\\nAIMessage(content=\\'Ciao!\\', additional_kwargs={\\'refusal\\': None}, response_metadata={\\'token_usage\\': {\\'completion_tokens\\': 3, \\'prompt_tokens\\': 20, \\'total_tokens\\': 23, \\'completion_tokens_details\\': {\\'accepted_prediction_tokens\\': 0, \\'audio_tokens\\': 0, \\'reasoning_tokens\\': 0, \\'rejected_prediction_tokens\\': 0}, \\'prompt_tokens_details\\': {\\'audio_tokens\\': 0, \\'cached_tokens\\': 0}}, \\'model_name\\': \\'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\\', \\'system_fingerprint\\': \\'fp_0705bf87c0\\', \\'finish_reason\\': \\'stop\\', \\'logprobs\\': None}, id=\\'run-32654a56-627c-40e1-a141-ad9350bbfd3e-0\\', usage_metadata={\\'input_tokens\\': 20, \\'output_tokens\\': 3, \\'total_tokens\\': 23, \\'input_token_details\\': {\\'audio\\': 0, \\'cache_read\\': 0}, \\'output_token_details\\': {\\'audio\\': 0, \\'reasoning\\': 0}})\\ntipIf we\\'ve enabled LangSmith, we can see that this run is logged to LangSmith, and can see the LangSmith trace. The LangSmith trace reports token usage information, latency, standard model parameters (such as temperature), and other information.\\nNote that ChatModels receive message objects as input and generate message objects as output. In addition to text content, message objects convey conversational roles and hold important data, such as tool calls and token usage counts.\\nLangChain also supports chat model inputs via strings or OpenAI format. The following are equivalent:\\nmodel.invoke(\"Hello\")model.invoke([{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello\"}])model.invoke([HumanMessage(\"Hello\")])\\nStreaming\\u200b\\nBecause chat models are Runnables, they expose a standard interface that includes async and streaming modes of invocation. This allows us to stream individual tokens from a chat model:\\nfor token in model.stream(messages):    print(token.content, end=\"|\")\\n|C|iao|!||\\nYou can find more details on streaming chat model outputs in this guide.\\nPrompt Templates\\u200b\\nRight now we are passing a list of messages directly into the language model. Where does this list of messages come from? Usually, it is constructed from a combination of user input and application logic. This application logic usually takes the raw user input and transforms it into a list of messages ready to pass to the language model. Common transformations include adding a system message or formatting a template with the user input.\\nPrompt templates are a concept in LangChain designed to assist with this transformation. They take in raw user input and return data (a prompt) that is ready to pass into a language model.\\nLet\\'s create a prompt template here. It will take in two user variables:\\n\\nlanguage: The language to translate text into\\ntext: The text to translate\\n\\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplatesystem_template = \"Translate the following from English into {language}\"prompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(    [(\"system\", system_template), (\"user\", \"{text}\")])API Reference:ChatPromptTemplate\\nNote that ChatPromptTemplate supports multiple message roles in a single template. We format the language parameter into the system message, and the user text into a user message.\\nThe input to this prompt template is a dictionary. We can play around with this prompt template by itself to see what it does by itself\\nprompt = prompt_template.invoke({\"language\": \"Italian\", \"text\": \"hi!\"})prompt\\nChatPromptValue(messages=[SystemMessage(content=\\'Translate the following from English into Italian\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), HumanMessage(content=\\'hi!\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})])\\nWe can see that it returns a ChatPromptValue that consists of two messages. If we want to access the messages directly we do:\\nprompt.to_messages()\\n[SystemMessage(content=\\'Translate the following from English into Italian\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), HumanMessage(content=\\'hi!\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})]\\nFinally, we can invoke the chat model on the formatted prompt:\\nresponse = model.invoke(prompt)print(response.content)\\nCiao!\\ntipMessage content can contain both text and content blocks with additional structure. See this guide for more information.\\nIf we take a look at the LangSmith trace, we can see exactly what prompt the chat model receives, along with token usage information, latency, standard model parameters (such as temperature), and other information.\\nConclusion\\u200b\\nThat\\'s it! In this tutorial you\\'ve learned how to create your first simple LLM application. You\\'ve learned how to work with language models, how to create a prompt template, and how to get great observability into applications you create with LangSmith.\\nThis just scratches the surface of what you will want to learn to become a proficient AI Engineer.
